**Step 1: 3D Modeling**

The first problem is 3D modeling and importing the 3D model into Gazebo. The 3D modeling itself is solidworks is pretty straight forward. The file to my 3D model is [linked here](https://github.com/ArthasMenethil-A/Delta-Robot-Trajectory-Planning/tree/main/models/Delta%20Parallel%20Robot). The main challenge comes from getting that 3D solidworks model imported into ROS. With a series Robot all you have to do, is to use URDF and follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeEzO_sX5H6TBD6EMGgV-qdhzxPY19m12) step by step. But DPR is not a series robot, [so we can't use URDF](https://answers.ros.org/question/216101/stewart-platform-how-can-i-connect-multiple-joints-to-the-same-child-link-but-different-parent-links/?sort=latest#sort-top). Instead we have to [use SDF](https://github.com/daniel-s-ingram/stewart) somehow.
